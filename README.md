Wrote a quick tool to create a TO-DO list in Houdini using PySide.
I'll be honest, the need for it was a bit forced as Houdini's own post it notes do the trick most of the time, but i wanted to see how i would tackle this.
I'm thinking this can be a good base for a feedback tool/or jira/shotgun integration tho.\

## Features

• Local .json file holds all the information, so it can be submited on p4v/git for others to have access to it.
On each hip file a new _todo.json file gets created, so if you swap between .hip that will update as well.\
